A keyword transposition cipher is a method of choosing a monoalphabetic substitution to encode a message. The substitution alphabet is determined by choosing a keyword, arranging the remaining letters of the alphabet in columns below the letters of the keyword, and then reading back the columns in the alphabetical order of the letters of the keyword.
