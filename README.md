## PlattsSEC HackerRank
This is the HackerRank solutions repo made by the Software Engineering Club at SUNY Plattsburgh. The goal is to post solutions to as many HackerRank problems as possible, in as many programming languages as possible.
Since there are a lot of HackerRank problems and a lot of programming languages out there, we figured it would be best if we open sourced this project.
Feel free to post solutions to problems of your choice. If you want to join our Discord server let one of the admins know :)
