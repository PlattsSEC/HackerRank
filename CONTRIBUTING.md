## Clone the repo
Feel free to clone the repository and add your solutions. If you are denied access contact one of the admins

## Create your own branch
Make sure that you work on your own branch instead of `master`. The naming convention for branches is `{your name}_{problem name}`. Note that it doesn't have to strictly follow this convention but it should be descriptive enough

## Respect the file hierarchy 
Please try to follow the hierarchy `{domain}/{category}/{problem name}`. For example, if you are working on [this](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-quickest-way-up?h_r=internal-search) problem, your path would be something like `algorithms/graph_theory/snakes_and_ladders`. Also, underscores only! The name of your file should be `{first_name/ first_name + last_name}`. So for example, `prithaj.py`, `kevin_boyette.hs`, `alex.c` etc are valid filenames.

## Commiting changes
After commiting your changes, push your branch and submit a PR for `master`. One of the admins would review it
